# Setup Template Code Metrics in this repository

You are integrating the `StalinChristopher/TemplateCodeMetrics` GitHub Action into the **current** repository so that every push to `main` reports a template-vs-custom code breakdown to a shared DevLake instance, visible in Grafana.

Reference: https://github.com/StalinChristopher/TemplateCodeMetrics

## What to do, in order

### 1. Detect project type and pick `extra_excludes`

Inspect the repo to determine its primary language/framework. Run `ls` at the repo root and look at file extensions in `src/` (or equivalent). Match to one of these:

- **React Native / Expo**: presence of `app.json` + `app.config.ts` or `metro.config.js` or `ios/Podfile`
- **Native iOS**: `*.xcodeproj`, `*.xcworkspace`, `Podfile`, no React Native indicators
- **Native Android**: `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` at root, no React Native indicators
- **Python**: `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, or `*.py` in `src/`
- **Go**: `go.mod`
- **Rust**: `Cargo.toml`
- **Java/Kotlin (non-Android)**: `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` outside `android/`
- **Node/JS/TS (non-RN)**: `package.json` without RN dependencies
- **Other / unknown**: skip `extra_excludes` and let the user fill in later

Match the detected type to the corresponding `extra_excludes` block:

| Type | `extra_excludes` |
|---|---|
| React Native | `[":!**/*.xcconfig.local", ":!ios/.bundle/**"]` |
| Native iOS | `[":!Carthage/**", ":!**/*.xcuserstate", ":!fastlane/report.xml", ":!fastlane/test_output/**"]` |
| Native Android | `[":!**/build/**", ":!**/captures/**", ":!**/proguard/**", ":!local.properties"]` |
| Python | `[":!**/migrations/**", ":!staticfiles/**", ":!**/__generated__/**", ":!**/*.pyi"]` |
| Go | `[":!**/*.pb.go", ":!**/*_generated.go", ":!**/zz_generated_*.go", ":!**/mock_*.go"]` |
| Rust / Java / Node / Other | `[]` |

If you can't determine the type, ask the user once: "What kind of project is this — React Native, native iOS, native Android, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Node/TS, or other?"

### 2. Pick a baseline commit

Ask the user one focused question:

> "What baseline commit should template-metrics use? Options: (a) **root commit** — the very first commit of this repo; (b) **a tagged release** like v1.0.0; (c) **a specific SHA** you'll paste."

For option (a), compute it with `git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD`.
For option (b), resolve the tag with `git rev-list -n 1 <tag>`.
For option (c), use the user's pasted SHA verbatim.

Validate the SHA exists in this repo's history with `git cat-file -e <sha>`. If it errors, tell the user the SHA isn't in this repo's history and ask again.

### 2b. Offer semantic scoring (opt-in)

Ask the user one focused yes/no question:

> "Enable Claude-judged **semantic** scoring alongside the deterministic git-diff score?
> - Adds a second `template_pct_semantic` value to the metrics that ignores Prettier reformats, renames, comment edits, and similar cosmetic changes.
> - Costs ~1¢ per commit using `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`.
> - Requires an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` GitHub Actions secret.
> - You can enable this later by adding the input + secret yourself; this question is just for convenience."

Remember the user's answer as `SEMANTIC_ENABLED` (true/false). It changes the workflow scaffolded in step 4 and the secrets checklist in step 5.

### 3. Create `.template-provenance.json`

Write to repo root:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "baseline_commit": "<the SHA from step 2>",
  "extra_excludes": <the array from step 1>
}
```

If `.template-provenance.json` already exists, ask the user before overwriting. Show them the diff.

### 4. Create `.github/workflows/template-metrics.yml`

Write to that exact path (create directories if missing):

```yaml
name: Template Metrics

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  measure:
    if: github.event_name != 'pull_request' || github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - uses: StalinChristopher/TemplateCodeMetrics@v1
        with:
          devlake-webhook-url: ${{ secrets.DEVLAKE_WEBHOOK_URL }}
          devlake-basic-auth:  ${{ secrets.DEVLAKE_BASIC_AUTH }}
```

If `SEMANTIC_ENABLED` from step 2b is true, also append this line under `with:`:

```yaml
          anthropic-api-key:   ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

If the file already exists, ask before overwriting.

### 5. Print the next-steps checklist

Output exactly this to the user (substitute the detected repo name where shown):

```
✓ Template Code Metrics scaffolded.

Still to do:
  [ ] Set GitHub Actions secret DEVLAKE_WEBHOOK_URL
      Get the value from your admin (the webhook URL of the shared DevLake instance).

  [ ] Set GitHub Actions secret DEVLAKE_BASIC_AUTH
      Format: user:pass — typically devlake:<your-team's-password>

  [ ] (Only if you enabled semantic scoring in step 2b)
      Set GitHub Actions secret ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
      An Anthropic API key with billing enabled. Used for the Claude-judged semantic score.

  [ ] Commit the two new files and push:
        git add .template-provenance.json .github/workflows/template-metrics.yml
        git commit -m "chore: add template-code-metrics tracking"
        git push

After the first workflow run, the repo will appear in the shared Grafana dashboard.

Quick gh-cli secret setup (run from this repo):
  gh secret set DEVLAKE_WEBHOOK_URL --body "<paste-from-admin>"
  gh secret set DEVLAKE_BASIC_AUTH  --body "<paste-from-admin>"
  gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY   --body "<paste-your-key>"   # only if semantic enabled

### 6. (Optional) Smoke-test locally

Offer to run a smoke test:

> "Want me to download the metric script and run it locally so we can see what the current template_pct will be?"

If yes:
- `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StalinChristopher/TemplateCodeMetrics/main/scripts/template-metrics.mjs -o /tmp/template-metrics.mjs`
- `node /tmp/template-metrics.mjs | jq '.percentages, .counts'`
- Show the user the output and a one-line interpretation: "This repo is currently X% template / Y% custom (Z LOC tracked)."

If no, just print the checklist and stop.

## Hard rules

- **Do not commit anything for the user.** Create the files, print the checklist, and let them review and commit.
- **Do not set secrets via `gh secret set` yourself.** The values come from the admin; print the commands instead.
- **Always validate the baseline SHA exists** before writing it into provenance — a bad SHA causes silent 100%-template numbers later.
- **Never modify files outside the repo root** beyond the two scaffolded files. Don't touch existing code, configs, package.json, etc.
- **Never run `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push`** as part of this setup.
- If something fails (e.g. user cancels, no git repo present, etc.) stop cleanly and tell the user what's missing — don't leave half-written files.
